		<p class="p-left">My name is Bryan Falls and I was born in Harlan County, Kentucky. I moved to Michigan when I was only 2 years old. I lived there until I turned 20.</p>

		<p class="p-right">At 20 years of age, I moved to Kentucky with my family. I have since worked as a waiter, manager, and most recently, a production line worker for Toyota.</p>
		<hr>

		<p class="p-left">After the birth of my son, my wife and I decided we wanted him to grow up in Michigan like we did. We've moved back to Micigan and I am now an aspiring  front-end web developer studying at <a href="http://www.grandcircus.co/" target="_blank">Grand Circus, Detroit.</a></p>
